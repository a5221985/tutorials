# Bluespec_BSV_Tutorial
A tutorial for learning the Bluespec BSV HLHDL (High Level Hardware
Design Langauge)

BSV is a High-level Hardware Design Language (HLHDL), taking its inspirations from Haskell and Term Rewriting Systems.
A commercial implementation of BSV (a compiler from BSV into Verilog) has been available from
Bluespec, Inc. (www.bluespec.com) since 2004, and has been used for several industrial-strength hardware designs.

Please start by reading the file <tt>START_HERE.pdf</tt>. Briefly:
the directory <tt>Example_Programs</tt> contains a series of example
programs starting from extremely simple ("Hello World") to fairly
complex (concurrent memory-to-memory Mergesort).  Each example has an
accompanying PDF file to explain it.  All examples can be built and
run using the <tt>Makefile</tt> in the <tt>Build</tt> directory
(provided you have an installation of the Bluespec BSV tools).

The <tt>Reference</tt> directory contains a series of PDF lectures
that explain the language syntax, semantics, libraries and idioms,
organized by topic.
