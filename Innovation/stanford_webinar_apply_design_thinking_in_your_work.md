# Stanford Webinar - Apply Design Thinking in Your Work #
1. "We believe the next generation innovators and leaders need to be great design thinkers." - David Kelley, Stanford Professor of Mechanical Engineering
2. Problem solving for everybody using design thinking
	1. A way of solving problems - a tool
	2. Does not replace other methods
		1. Scientific thinking
		2. Business thinking
3. Works well on large scale multidisciplinary problems
	1. For problems with difficult to get boundary conditions and lots of data
	2. Design problems doesn't have enough data
		1. We are projecting and designing things that occur in the future (no data yet)
4. Transforming work:
	1. Work is a place where people are organized around tasks and skills
		1. Organized around tasks that have to get done
			1. Vertical tasks
				1. Marketing
				2. Manufacturing
				3. Operations
				4. Design
				5. Engineering
				6. Research
		2. Organized around skills people have in the different domains
	2. Work is also a collection of behaviors
		1. Culture of an organization is a collection of behaviors
			1. What do we do when we go to work
				1. Lots of planning and budget meetings?
				2. Most time is spent on designing and building?
	3. To transform work, we need to substitute
		1. new behaviors for old
			1. Stuff we do at work doesn't feel so productive or generative
				1. Design methods to supercharge the environment
		2. new design thinking skills
			1. Used to change the way work occurs for us
	4. You change the things with training and modeling the new behaviors
		1. Step 1: learn the skills - on new ideas
			1. Train myself
				1. What kind of behavior do creative people use
				2. What kind of mindset do creative people engage in
		2. Step 2: model the new behaviors
			1. If I behave like a creative person, staff and team will emulate me
5. Design Thinking - Process (+ Mindsets)
	1. Empathize
		1. Don't start with problem but start with people
		2. People are interesting to observe
	2. Define
		1. Re-define the problem
	3. Ideate
		1. Generate lots and lots of ideas
			1. More ideas, the better the choices would be
	4. Prototype (repeat this step and next step) - used to understand the problem in a different way
		1. Build stuff
	5. Test
		1. Test stuff
6. Design Thinking - Mindsets - even if we don't use the process
	1. Bias towards action
		1.
